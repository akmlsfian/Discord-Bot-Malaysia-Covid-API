# [DEPRECIATED!] Discord-Covid-API
> API taken from Covid API to display on Discord Channel

## Why?
This is just a small project for personal knowledge and exposure into NodeJS backend server. I did this when i was 20 Years old lmao.

### Feature:
- The Discord Bot will reset the channel name (channel that is static) with the current stats of Covid with given channel ID
- Message "!mal" on discord server will respond with Malaysia Covid Statistic 
- Message "!world" on discord server will respond with World Covid Statistic

The api was taken from
```js 
const covid = require('novelcovid');
```
